### Introduction

Data Governance and Data QualityData quality is often seen as a one-time project—”Fix the data and we’re done.” Even if there is awareness that data quality requires ongoing attention, the lack of formal accountability for the data is a critical component that causes many data quality initiatives to dwindle over time or fail completely. It is also the reason that many application development projects, once in production, cannot uphold the quality of data required by the business. Data governance is the missing link that provides the structure and process for making decisions about a company’s data. It ensures that the appropriate people are engaged to manage information throughout its life cycle. Implementing data governance and stewardship is important for the sustainability of data quality.


### Approach

The approach is to Define, Manage, Track and Improve data quality.

#### 1. Project Kickoff
During the kickoff, the stakeholders document business processes, products, and deliverables that are critical for high-quality data. They also document critical data, systems that support business processes and outcomes, and the known data quality issues. The group reviews the data quality project approach and identifies key phase deliverables and roles. The kickoff concludes with a discussion of roles and responsibilities and management routines. After the kickoff, prepare a document defining scope, program strategy, governance and management routines, and operational and technology support. 

##### Collect Data Quality Details and Key Issues
While conducting the capability assessment, the team should collect a list of data quality issues (and associated measures where available). This is similar to conducting a survey of data quality. What are the key pain points? Which critical data sets are having particular issues? Are managers confident in the information they are using? Are there customer issues driven by data quality problems? Answers to these questions should be documented and then prioritized.
 
##### Prepare a Data Quality Capabilities Gap Analysis Report
Through this activity, a DQ capabilities gap analysis report has to be prepared to address any weaknesses within current data quality capabilities. This gap analysis is a major input in program building and planning. Identified weaknesses in capability are mitigated through the execution of data quality projects.

#### 2. Assess current state of data quality
